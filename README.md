This is a public repository where users can open issues for the monospaced font [Gintronic](https://markfromberg.com/projects/gintronic/) by Mark Fr√∂mberg. 

## How to use

### Installation

#### Mac
Normally you just copy the font file(s) into your System Fonts Folder `/Library/Fonts/`.
It is possible to put subfolders into that folder, I often have a folder for each font family in there.
After putting the fonts there, they are immediately available, but some apps need a restart.

You can also use a font manager like Font Book, but honestly, that is not necessary at all.

### Issues, Questions, Discussions
- I am currently feeding the [discussions board](https://github.com/Mark2Mark/gintronic/discussions), which is the new place for everything that is not necessarily an issue.
- If you have any issues that are not covered by the [issues](https://github.com/Mark2Mark/gintronic/issues) in this repository, please open a new one.

### OpenType Features
You can activate or deactivate several font features to your likings.
A growing collection of how to do that in several IDEs can be found [here](https://github.com/Mark2Mark/gintronic/discussions/11)
